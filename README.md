# SI
SI Android Game

Made in Processing for Android

SI is an Android game in which the player is trying to get two shapes to have equal area.

The player simply slides their finger to control the radius of a randomly selected shape and wants to make that shape have equal area to another randomly selected shape.
The tricky part is that the shapes can be different. In the original game mode, the shapes can be a circle or any regular polygon up to a hexagon.
Other game modes introduce other shapes or catches.

SI is the final iteration in this project.
